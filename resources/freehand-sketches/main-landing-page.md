The black box in the image represents the screen size for the browser. Across the top is some sort of navigation bar.  The main content of the page is placed into digital cards. 

Each card displayed on the screen will have a specific call to action:
* Take control of digital life -> signup
* Email -> Learn more about our email privacy
* Passwords -> Learn more about our password privacy
* Web -> Learn more about our web privacy
* etc.

**The most important concept on this screen is having clear and specific call to actions.** Each call to action should drive the user further into the website and closer to signing up. None of the content in the screen shot is important, the content is merely to show a balance between the items on the page and the URLs listed in the [marketing site outline](../marketing-site-outline.md).
