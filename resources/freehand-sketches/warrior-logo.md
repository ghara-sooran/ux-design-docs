What does a Persian warrior look like?

The freehand sketch was what first popped into my head when I thought of a [Persian] warrior. However, as much as the logo looks like a warrior, it should also be friendly looking. That is the idea behind the picture of the Cartoonish Character above. We need to build a story as a company that we take people's privacy & security seriously but that we are also a warm & friendly company.

Another idea, if we stick with GharaSoo as the working company name, could be a "G" with two spears (similar to below) in an "X" shape going through the "G"
