# Freehand Sketches

Often times it is easier to quick draw something freehand, rather than using a design tool. These pages capture those freehand drawings and the context around them.

To contribute a new freehand sketch.  Save the image in the folder and then create a new markdown file linking to the image with a brief discussion of what the sketch represents.
