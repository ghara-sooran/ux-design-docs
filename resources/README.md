# Design Resources
The resources folder contains supporting artifacts used during the design process.  Examples of resources used during the design process include:
* White-board & freehand sketches
* Inspirational links
* Other sources of inspiration

The goal of these resources is to provide a complete picture of our thought process and all available context which contributed to the final designs. This will help future team members building a greater understanding of how and why certain descisions were made.
