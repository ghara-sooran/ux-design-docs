# Marketing Site Outline
Below is a rough outlone of the URLs we expect to serve for the marketing site.  This is not an exhaustive list, but represents our public facing URLs.  A URL should be added to the list if it meets any of the following criteria:
* Bookmarkable - Users may want to bookmark the current page to refer back to later
* Sharable - Users may want to share the content of the current page to friends
* Anchorable - Users may expect the page to exist without any prior knowledge

The list of URLs is divided into two sections: Public & Authenticated. Public URLs are accessible by anyone on the internet without the need to create a user account. Authenticated URLs require an individual to have created an account and be currently signed into that account.
