## Getting Started

This repository is used to track and manage all aspects of the UX design process for Ghara Sooran. This repository should faciliate all document management, collaboration, and project management needs for UX design.

To get started, make sure you have [git]() installed on your desktop.  You can either use the [desktop GUI]() or the [git-cli](), the rest of this guide will provide instructions for setting up your repository with the `git-cli`.

_Note: If you haven't used `git` before, there are several getting started guides available on the internet, here are a few we think are worth checking out:_
* Getting started guide 1

Once `git` is setup locally, run the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ghara-sooran/ux-design-docs.git
```
_If you are using the desktop GUI, point the GUI to the above URL._

Congratulations! You have all of the documents setup locally and are now ready to begin editing.

## [Resources]()
The resources folder contains supporting artifacts used during the design process.  Examples of resources used during the design process include:
* White-board & freehand sketches
* Inspirational links
* Other sources of inspiration

The goal of these resources is to provide a complete picture of our thought process and all available context which contributed to the final designs. This will help future team members building a greater understanding of how and why certain descisions were made.

## [Design Artifacts]()
The design artifacts represent the raw outputs from the design process.  These designs will be used downstream in the development of UI components and prototypes during the development process. Examples of design artifacts include:
* Sketch / Adobe XD / Figma design files
* PNG / SVG / JPEG / etc. image files
* ...

## [Project Management](./projects)
To faciliate collaboration and manage our projess, we utilize [issues](/issues) and [project boards](./projects) respectively. All updates should be tracked through an issue.
